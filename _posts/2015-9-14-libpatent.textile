The <a href="https://libpatent.com">libpatent</a> project started off as a fun idea for a research tool focused on defensive patent searches.  The patent system would benefit a lot from improved patent quality, and the more efficient dispatch of low quality patents, so hopefully one day this tool will prove useful to researches towards that goal.

It took a few years to bring to fruition.  But finally <a href="https://libpatent.com">libpatent.com</a> is now a usable patent research website.  It feels great to release a useful project to the world -- it's too easy to let a side project languish at an 80% complete state.  

Right now the site consists of a fairly comprehensive search index and some nice displays of patent data.  But I have hopes to develop more exapnsive features.

Most of the technical challenges were simply traditional data processing concerns: data formats and data quality.  Of course the project also gave me an opportunity to get more familiar with inverted indexes, convolution nerual networks, regression models, plus a bunch of other cool technology.  

So if you need to do any patent research tasks, please consider trying <a href="https://libpatent.com">libpatent.com</a>.
