*1.  My New Ibook Charger Shtick*

Steve Jobs you *scoundrel*! $80 for a new battery cable, is that right?!  If had $80 dollars I would not own a laptop which emit sparks.

<br/>*2. Questionable  Labor Relations*

A cursory search on Apple's manufacturing process led to a grim news story.  "According to various Chinese media reports, the worker at Chinese manufacturer Foxconn committed suicide last week after a fourth-generation iPhone prototype for which he was responsible went missing."  <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10291701-37.html">Apple Worker Commits Suicide</a>.  I'm sure most hardware manufacturing operations are based in third world countries with terrible labor practices but this story makes the problem tough to ignore.

<br/>*3.  Are macs status symbols?*

This is simple enough.  With a free, open source, hardware independent, stable, fast alternative like linux, why choose to spend a thousand dollars+ on an ibook?  It's essentially declaring to the world that you have disposable income you choose to *waste*.   It's a little bourgeois.

<br/>At the end of the day it's nice to have community values in your computer
