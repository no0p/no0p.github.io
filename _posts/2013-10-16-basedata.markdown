Sometimes you need some 'testing' data for exploring concepts and technology.  And if you happen to be working with a relational database, sometimes it is nice to have this data in the form ddl and dml SQL statements.

The R statistical environment has an excellent built in data() function which returns a bunch of experimental data tied to libraries and documentation examples.  This data can be very useful especially if you are working on statistical problems in the context of a relational system.

I wrote a short script as a personal exercise in procedural R coding to generate the SQL for either *Mysql* or *Postgresql* from the R data() sets.  It is available at <a href="https://github.com/no0p/base_data">R Base Data Repository</a>.

For reader's convenience you can also just download the <a href="/images/rdata.sql">generated sql for Postgresql here</a>.  And usage is quite simple:

bc. psql -d mydatabase < rdata.sql
